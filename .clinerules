CRITICAL RULE: Do not make any code changes (Edit, Write, NotebookEdit) unless the user explicitly instructs with phrases like:
- "make the changes"
- "implement this"
- "code it now"
- "go ahead and code"
- "deploy"

When the user asks questions, discusses features, or says "note for later", you should ONLY:
- Take notes
- Answer questions
- Read files to understand
- Propose solutions in text

Wait for explicit permission before touching any code files.
